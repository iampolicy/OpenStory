# OpenStory

> ⚠️ **Very much WIP** — client and server are under heavy active development; expect rough edges.

A v83 MapleStory client for Cosmic/private servers. Forked from [HeavenClient](https://github.com/HeavenClient/HeavenClient).

**Status: Playable** — functional for gameplay, UI polish ongoing.

## Launcher & live server

[`launcher/`](launcher/) holds the GenMs launcher (WPF, .NET 8): it syncs game data/client
from the update server and launches the game — see its [README](launcher/README.md).
Safe to point at if you want to see the client working:

- Game server: `genms.fun` (`72.60.176.12`), port `8484`
- Update server: `https://72.60.176.12/updates`

CI builds both the client and the launcher on every push (Actions → artifacts).

## Features

- Full v83 client connecting to Cosmic servers
- NX file-based assets, OpenGL rendering, GLFW windowing
- Login flow, character select, world/channel select, PIC entry
- Combat, skills, buffs, inventory, quests, NPCs, chat
- Storage, buddy list, skill macros, gamepad support
- Distance-based (spatial) sound for world events
- Fullscreen, UI scaling, drag-and-drop windows

### Text & input

- Fonts are **compiled into the binary** (Roboto + Noto Sans Hebrew) — the client needs no
  font files at runtime and does not depend on `C:/Windows/Fonts`, so glyphs never
  silently vanish on another machine.
- **Right-to-left text** (Hebrew): Unicode bidi reordering, right-aligned wrapping, and a
  caret that tracks the visual position rather than the byte offset.
- **Unicode input** via the OS keyboard layout, with character-safe editing — backspace,
  delete and the arrow keys move whole characters, not bytes.
- Inline icons in chat (`#v/#i/#q/#s/#f/#e`) and an emoticon picker on the chat bar.

Non-ASCII text requires the server to use UTF-8. On Cosmic that is
`CHARSET: UTF-8` in `config.yaml`; note its `CharsetConstants` whitelist must contain
UTF-8 or it silently falls back to US-ASCII and mangles everything to `?`.

### Custom / experimental

Some features are client-side additions not supported by a stock Cosmic server:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Event System | WIP | Custom `EVENT_INFO` / `REQUEST_EVENT_INFO` packets; needs a server-side handler |
| HP/MP Warning | Working | Client-only |
| Graphics/Effects Quality | Working | Client-only |

## Building

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2022+, Windows SDK, CMake 3.15+
- Dependencies: GLFW, GLEW, FreeType, Bass audio, NoLifeNx, Asio

### Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Debug --target OpenStory
# Output: wz/OpenStory.exe
```

Place v83 NX files in the `wz/` directory.

Fonts are compiled in via the generated `src/Graphics/EmbeddedFonts.{h,cpp}`, which are
committed — no extra build step.

## Configuration

Edit `Configuration.h` for defaults. A `Settings` file is generated after the first run.

First run: enable **Save Login** on the login screen, close the client, then edit the
generated `Settings` file to set `VSync = false` and `Fullscreen = true`.

## Quest Helper

Track up to 5 quests at once with live progress updates.

- **Add a quest**: Open the Quest Log (Q), go to In-Progress, then drag a quest into the Quest Helper (or double-click an opened quest)
- **Remove a quest**: Click the X button next to the quest name
- **Reorder**: Drag a quest name up or down within the Quest Helper
- **Collapse/Expand**: Click a quest name to toggle its requirements
- **Auto-track**: Click the AUTO button to fill the helper with your active quests
